                            <h4>Reflection</h4>
                            <p>Joining Remitano in 2022 marked one of the most intense and transformative phases of my career. From day one, I was trusted to work on RENEC, a new token ecosystem that combined fintech, blockchain, and large-scale system design. It pushed me beyond just "writing code" into thinking like a system architect and product engineer.</p>
                            <p>Working closely with Product Managers, Infrastructure, Blockchain, Operations, and Compliance teams gave me a much deeper understanding of how crypto products grow users, manage risk, and operate at scale—not just how they are built.</p>
                            <p>This journey reshaped my mindset. I learned to work relentlessly, think systematically, and take true ownership of the systems I built. I left not because the work was done, but because I was ready to take on bigger problems, broader impact, and products that serve even larger communities.</p>

                            <p>After 3 months since joining the company, I received the title of "Unsung Hero" of the company. It's really great for a newbie like me. Here I have learned a lot of things to develop myself in all aspects and constantly improve myself.</p>
                            <p>2021 is a year full of newness as well as many sadness when many colleagues and teams leave the company. Me and my team have done something meaningful for our company.</p>
                            <p>We are very grateful to the company and our boss for creating all conditions for us to develop as well as deploy our ideas to the system, learn and improve more. Hope to be able to work with everyone again in the future and rest assured I always keep in touch with everyone :D</p>
                            <p>I quit my job simply to find something new, more experiential and to work on bigger problems, products that serve more users.</p>
