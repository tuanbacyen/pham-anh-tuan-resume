# Hey there! 👋

This is my online resume - because PDFs are so 2010.

## What's this?

A simple HTML/CSS resume that I can share with anyone, anywhere. No more "Can you send me your CV?" - just drop the link and done!

**Live at:** [tuanbacyen.github.io/pham-anh-tuan-resume](https://tuanbacyen.github.io/pham-anh-tuan-resume/)

## Tech Stack

Nothing fancy here:
- HTML (yes, the classic one)
- CSS (with some gradients to look cool)
- A sprinkle of Google Fonts

No JavaScript, no frameworks, no 500MB of node_modules. Just pure, simple web.

## Why?

- Fast to load
- Easy to update
- Works everywhere
- Looks good when printed (Ctrl+P friendly)
- No "Please disable your ad blocker" popups

- Making AI tools actually useful
